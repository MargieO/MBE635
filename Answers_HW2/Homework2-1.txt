###1. Without using a text editor examine the contents of the file HapMap.fas.txt

    ###- How many lines does this file contain?

		wc -l HapMap.fas.txt 
		
 		 378672 HapMap.fas.txt

    ###- How many characters?    (Hint: check out the options of wc)

		wc -m HapMap.fas.txt 
		
 		15503584 HapMap.fas.txt


    ###- What is the first line of this file?    (Hint: read the man page of head)

		head -1 HapMap.fas.txt 
		
		>TP1_query_64

    ###- What are the last 3 lines?    (Hint: read the man page of tail)

		tail -3 HapMap.fas.txt
		 
		CGATTTTTTTTTTTTATCAAAAATGTTATTTTTCTTATTTTGCCGCTGTCTTAAATGGCCCGCT
		>TP95869_hit_64
		CGATTTTTTTTTTTTATCAAAAATGTTATTTTTCTTATTTTGCCGCTGTCTTAAATGGCCCTCT

    ###- How many sequences are in the file?    (Hint: use grep)

		grep '^[AGCT]\{1,\}$' HapMap.fas.txt > HapMapSeq
		wc -l HapMapSeq 
		
		189336 HapMapSeq
		 
		189336 sequences

###2. Using the file, grep_data.txt, write a series of grep statements that do the following:

  ###Print all lines that contain a phone number with an extension (the letter x or X followed by four digits).
  
  	grep '[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\} x[0-9]\{4\}' grep_data.txt

  ###Print all lines that begin with three digits followed by a blank using the repetition specifier ({})
  
  	grep '^[0-9]\{3\} ' grep_data.txt 

  ###Print all lines containing a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) followed by a single character followed by the same vowel again. Thus, it will find “eve” or “adam” but not “vera”. Hint: \( and \).

	grep '\([aeiouAEIOU]\)[a-zA-Z]\1' grep_data.txt

  ###Print all lines that do not begin with a capital S.

	grep '[^S].*$' grep_data.txt

###Write grep statements that use command-line options along with the pattern to do the following:

  ###Print all lines that contain CA in either uppercase or lowercase.
  
  		grep '[Cc][Aa]' grep_data.txt 

  ###Print all lines that contain an email address (they have an @ in them), preceded by the line number.
  
  		grep -n @ grep_data.txt

  ###Print all lines that do not contain the word Sep. (including the period).
  
  		grep '[^Sep.]' grep_data.txt 

  ###Print all lines that contain the word de as a whole word.
  
  		grep ' de ' grep_data.txt
