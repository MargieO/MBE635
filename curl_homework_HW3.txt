Write a curl command to retrieve the Alabama tree boundaries csv file from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database,
 https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/

Now add to this command to determine how many words are in this file.

Now retrieve data from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida and Massachusetts and count the words

Save these to individually named files in one step.

Write a command to figure out what all of these numbers are.

-------------
Now explore other files a little bit:

How many species of pine trees were used for this entire database?

Where were Cladonia squamosa in the fungal database?

use grep search term with -n to get the line number

---------------
Look at the help manual for curl and tell me how you would only download a file if it had been 
updated either before or after a certain data.

$ curl -z 21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html

--------------------------
Find a database that might be useful in your research and write the commmand to retrieve the useful datafiles
